2D disc physics engine in Rust. 
Started out with a naive Typescript implementation port, then added a spatial hash grid to speed up collisions. Attempted premature optimization with SoA and a sweep-and-prune system I didn't understand. Dropped the project due to technical debt. After new interest in fluid simulations, decided to rework this in preparation for a FLIP fluid sim. Having a little more experience, fixed critical bottlenecks (cloning the state every frame to pass to render by value). Still encountered physics issues that were fixed by switching from Euler's method kinematics to Verlet integration. Changing the grid to be a 2DArray (Vec wrapper) of Vecs improved performance, then changing to a 3DArray improved it again. Successfully parallelized collisions by using Arc<Atomic> for state data structures.
